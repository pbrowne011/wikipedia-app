# wikipedia-app

An app that utilizes the Wikipedia API to present requested data to the user.

My ideas for this project are as follows (and will depend on the API's capabilities):

* Present a random Wikipedia article to a user
* Present a list of articles to a user based on their search request
* Presesnt statistics to a user based on articles (how many include the word "unicorn", average number of authors, etc.)
* When given a topic, present a map of the subheadlines (i.e., when given "Mathematics" or "Math", return a list of all of the articles in the gigantic subfield on math).
* Display an individual Wikipedia user's daily statistics
* Display daily statistics of Wikipedia based on GMT time (number of edits, number of pageviews, etc.)
* Perform Wikipedia research in a certain area (golf, poker, programming, AI, EA, etc.)

Design ideas
* Use CSS and HTML formatting of Wikipedia (color scheme, logo, fonts, etc.). Get a feel for Wikipedia.
* Make the interface as simple as possible for the user to navigate

Ideas for project completion
* Learn the basics of RESTful APIs (only if Wikipedia's API counts as one)
* Design the simples possible app in Flask, Node.js, whatever works (so long as it works!). No fancy CSS or formatting at first, only pick a subset of one bullet point from the list, make sure it is durable/functional, etc.
* Finish the functional part by Wednesday (Friday at latest)
* Come up with a specific architecture/design plan

Let's see how this goes!
